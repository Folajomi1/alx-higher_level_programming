0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

This project focuses on the integration of two powerful technologies: databases and Python. In the first part, we will utilize the MySQLdb module to establish a connection with a MySQL database and execute SQL queries. In the second part, we will employ SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), to interact with the database using Python code instead of writing direct SQL queries. The goal is to abstract the storage details and provide a seamless way to manipulate objects without worrying about the underlying database implementation.
